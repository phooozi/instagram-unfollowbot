# Python instagram-unfollowbot

This is an instagram bot that allows you to see who is currently not following you back and to see who you will need to have a talk with :)!
Just run the program with your inputted username/pw and the bot will do the searching for you.

## Possible things to add in the future:
- Unfollow users that aren't following back
- Ability to look at other people's following/not following list
- GUI

## NOTE: This is just a fun small project that I made when learning to develop.
